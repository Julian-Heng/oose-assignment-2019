     * Presumably, all output will be done within this option as the
     * device that provides the coordinates in GpsLocator calls the hook
     * methods which work independently to each other
     *
     * Also note: This method is testing code, this option is expected
     * to be replaced by a proper implementation of an actual Tracking
     * option
     *
     * Also note note: ReachedPoint is not going to be tested because
     *                 that requires user action and this test is automated
     *
     * Also note note note: The data is _not_ shared among the subclasses that
     *                      extends GpsLocator as it is presumed that they are
     *                      shared using threads(?) and that constructing them
     *                      is good enough to make them run on their own
     *                      threads. So to make this easier on me, all the
     *                      subclasses have their own copy of their own points
     *                      and their own local variables like next and curr
     *                      (both of which is used within DistanceShow and
     *                      WaypointShow). Yes, more work is needed on the
     *                      subclasses when properly implementing it, but
     *                      I need these classes to work with the provided
     *                      GpsLocator stub, so some compromises is needed
