Predefined Routes
  - Name
  - Description
  - Starting Location
  - Finishing Location
  - Can be same as the start, like a loop
  - Series of zero or more waypoints
  - Contains other routes (Composite Pattern)
  - Let a route be an ArrayList of points and subroutes

Points
  - Latitude (-90, 90)
  - Longitude (-180, 180)
  - Altitude (-inf, inf)

Input
  - Subroutes can be declared before and after use
  - Therefore, may need a reference to update it?
  - Have a map of routes, where the value can contain other value in the
    same map

Classes
  - RouteNode <Abstract>
  - Route <Composite>
      - Must have name and description
      - ArrayList of RouteNodes, which in turn can contain a Route or
        Point
  - Point <Must end on a point>
      - Description is optional, due to end point


Need a strategy pattern(?) for adding a new route/point to a route due
to three possible paths:
 1. End is a point and adding a new point
 2. End is a point and adding a new route
 3. End is a route and adding a new route

Maybe a factory might be better??

add() method takes in a RouteNode, thus doesn't know it it is a route
or point. Current plan is to scan the file first for subroutes, then make
a dependency graph(?) then make the routes accordingly. Alternate plan is
to construct all the routes, without any nodes, then add the points into
the routes, then perform a check to see if the starting and ending of the
route and subroutes are within 10m horizontally and 2m vertically
